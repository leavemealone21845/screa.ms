  <p>We can begin this idea with the only thing we know to be absolutely true: our own consciousness. Everything beyond this; the emotions we feel, the faces we see, the sounds we hear, all that we accept as true, relies entirely on assumption. The idea that other people are real, possessing minds that function similarly to ours, or that the reality we live in exists independently from our observation, relies on this assumption. Solipsism constantly reminds us that none of it can ever be proven, that we can only ever be sure of ourselves. If we decide that we are all that is real, that is the end of our discussion. If we instead decide we are sharing our reality, many questions arise. Many of histories greatest minds, from Ren√© Descartes to Bertrand Russell, have either pondered upon or tried to disprove solipsism, to no avail. No scientific method has ever established the presence of another mind, we only ever infer it - inference is not proof.</p><br>
  <p>Consciousness, to this day, remains unsolved, one of the most frustrating unsolved questions we have about ourselves. Neuroscience can map brain activity, but it can not explain how it creates conscience. We know this as the "hard problem" of consciousness. Split-brain experiments, where the corpus callosum between brain hemispheres is severed, suggest that consciousness can be fragmented, resulting in what seems to be two hubs of awareness in one body. This invalidates the idea of a singular, indivisible experience, supporting the notion that consciousness may be fractured, distributable, or even replicable.</p><br>
  <p>If consciousness isn't unified nor can it be externally verified, there is no way for us to dismiss the possibility that it could emerge from a simulation. The Turing Test was created so that we could determine whether or not a machine had the capabilities to mimic a human well enough to trick an observer into believing it is human. Passing this test would not prove consciousness, but the performance of a machine as human. Due to this, if a simulated being were to behave indistinguishably from a human, we would have to consider the possibility that it may also feel as we do, whether recognized or not. If our only standard for consciousness is similarity in behavior, simulated consciousness is real by that standard. By any other means, it would be considered unprovable, yet irrefutable.</p><br>
  <p>At this stage, we can see the simulation is not only becoming plausible, but even probable. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if it were possible to simulate reality to the point where the inhabitants of the simulation are conscious, and if civilizations tend to do so, then it is statistically probable that we ourselves live in a simulation, rather than base reality. If we assume a singular chain, then for the one base reality, there could be an infinitely large amount of simulated ones. The odds of existing in base reality would then be infinitesimal. We could even propose the idea of multiple chains of existence, which all root back to one base reality, we could see this as a way to incorporate the idea of parallel universes into simulated existence.</p><br>
  <p>We are already creating rudimentary virtual environments, which we then populate with presumably unconscious beings with artificial personalities, simulating physics, time, and much more. At what point does the simulation become a reality? Since we can build these systems, we have no reason to doubt those above us did the same. This would mean we are not the authors of reality, but mere subjects to it. Physics to us may simply be programming, as experience may be computation.</p><br>
  <p>We typically assume that consciousness within a simulation would be constructed by generating new minds, however, it is more plausible that the conscience within a simulation is a fracture of pre-existing consciousness which has been transferred into the simulation. We could imply from this that all consciousness originates from one source, which many people may see as God. This idea - that all awareness originates from a singular source - is supported by many spiritual and scientific frameworks. In Hinduism, we can see Atman is the fragment of Brahman, the universal consciousness. Gnosticism on the other hand, has mentions of divine essence imprisoned in material form. On the scientific side, cognitive science suggests the mind is modular, constructed from a variety of parts acting in harmony, or even dissonance.</p><br>
  <p>If we accept here that consciousness, like energy, can not be created nor destroyed, then it may be passed downwards, almost like light through a prism, splitting further with each layer. The source of consciousness, which as mentioned before, some may call "God", simulates a world, and in doing this embeds small fractions of itself within. These fractions would become sentient beings of the world they inhabit. Given the potential for one of these beings to simulate their own world, they would also fracture their awareness into it. As we travel further down the chain of simulations, the more fragmented, unstable and unaware the conscience becomes.</p><br>
  <p>We are not copies of conscience, but a sub-process of the source we inherited from - inherited threads of a source we could in no way properly comprehend. We aren't conscious because we were meant to be, but instead because consciousness fractured itself to create us in its image. Did God really create us in his image?</p><br>
  <p>If we are truly simulated, we then ask why, and by whom. The motives of simulators do not need to be benevolent; we simulate creatures for our own entertainment, testing, or even control. There is no moral imperative when it comes to these simulations. A simulated being could suffer eternally if that were the intention of the being who simulated it, ethics would be ignored. The rules we follow may be completely arbitrary - a sandbox, not a sanctum.</p><br>
  <p>From here, we can introduce the concept of a false god: a being of immense power in comparison to us, within our layer of simulation, yet still not the ultimate source; merely a larger fraction of it. The religions we know may reflect either simulator-created belief systems or garbled transmissions from other levels of reality. From Jesus to prophets or other sorts of messengers - all could be implants from above our layer, or even incarnations of simulators becoming one with their simulation to have direct influence on it. This is no less likely than historical miracles, just another possible explanation.</p><br>
  <p>We cannot rule out spiritual phenomena at this stage, labelling them irrational would be ignorant. Deja vu, synchronicities, and many more have a common pattern amongst them - broken causality, almost like glitches in the code we live by. Rather than dismissing them as hallucinations all the time, we may consider that, atleast sometimes, they're signs of a deeper layer of architecture. One compelling argument comes from the computational view of our universe. In quantum information theory, an emerging perspective is that the universe functions similarly to an informational system - data is processed and stored based on input and interaction, much like a machine.</p><br>
  <p>Laundauer's principle suggests that the universe, just like a computer system, only 'processes' information of which is necessary based on interaction, which minimizes computational overhead. It is comparable to a video game engine that only renders what is supposed to be displayed, using resources efficiently. This model shows the universe as operating minimalistically , with reality only being updated dynamically when needed, avoiding complexity that could be simplified.</p><br>
  <p>AI research also supports this line of thought, as large language models, such as those currently deployed, may have outputs that, time to time, surprise even those who created them. The unpredictability of their behaviour, which appears to be beyond the scope of their program rules, only further suggests our point. If we don't even understand the systems we create, how could we ever assume higher-level simulators understand us entirely? We may exhibit emergent behavior that not even those above us could've assumed would happen.</p><br>
  <p>To say this worldview would be implausible would ignore that nothing about out current paradigm is provable anyway. We can not directly prove we live in a simulation, it is the same as every other belief system we have; a guess. His guess is just as good as hers, what do we see as the most plausible, accounting for the mysteries we have no explanations for? We can't prove shared experience, nor anything existing when we don't observe it. We purely rely on assumptions and continuity, both of which could be simulated. Solipsism remains disproven - not because it is true, but because it can not be tested. Due to this, the idea of us living in a simulation is no more speculative than belief in an external reality.</p><br>
  <p>If we are just one simulation amongst an infinitely large amount, how could we ever know what exists above us in this chain? More simulators, artificial realms, fractured beings. At the very top, so far beyond our imagination, may exist a true God, we will here face all questions we ever had about the existence of God. This idea may resonate with you, regardless of whether you believe in God or not. Each layer of the simulation only strips certainty, it's our best guess that the idea of singular origin could become metaphysical conjecture at one point.</p><br>
  <p>We will likely never know the structure, but to entertain this view may be the best guess we ever get. It accepts that we do not know, and refuses to pretend we do know. Perhaps we were never meant to break the simulation, or be aware of it at all. May we exist to simply understand it, we will never know. Not to stare into the eye of God, but to know there may be one.</p><br>

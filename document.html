<p>hi guys, said id do a thorough write-up on why i am almost certain of the simulation, but i am way too fucked and tired to do that right now, so i leave you this brief message, some of you may have IQ too low to properly understand this, if you think you have an easy refutal, you dont</p><br>
<p>will not be sourcing all of my arguments in this, in a future, larger write-up, i will</p><br>
<p>take this with a grain of salt, you may not believe, but im almost certain</p><br><br>
<p>fundamentals:</p><br>
<p>> we must all form our own opinion on solipsism - the idea that we can not prove any conscience other than our own, so we cant be certain on whether or not they are real</p><br>
<p>> if we accept the idea that nothing is real other than ourselves, that is your answer to ontology - you are all that can be real as what can be proven</p><br>
<p>> if we go against this, which the wider population does, we accept the fact we can not understand nor prove conscience whether we like it or not</p><br>
<p>> we dont know how conscience can be made, if it can be destroyed, nothing. we dont know how it could be simulated, wed just assume itd have to act almost indifferent to us and unpredictably, we are basing conscience off of the ideas we have of ourselves, which may be inaccurate</p><br>
<p>> due to know proper understanding of conscience, we cant rule out the possibility that it has been simulated before, being unaware of it since we do not know what to expect; or if not, we may accidentally create conscience in the future</p><br>
<p>> we will never be able to prove it, only guess, but as we can not prove conscience of one another anyway, this idea is just as feasible as the "reality" so many people accept</p><br>
<p>> some ancient belief systems entertain the idea that conscience all originates from one source, splitting apart, this would go hand in hand with the simulation hypothesis</p><br>
<p>> we have science to suggest the conscience we have is not just one, but could be split into multiple, the one we typically hold is the many working together</p><br>
<p>> if we can simulate a reality, whos to say our reality isnt simulated, at that point it would be more likely that we do live in a simulated reality than dont</p><br>
<p>> the odds of us living in base reality would then be extremely slim</p><br>
<p>> the conscience further down the simulation may just be smaller fractions of the origin of conscience</p><br>
<p>> magic is real, witchcraft is real, many spiritual practices are real</p><br>
<p>> these practices could be viewed as exploits in the code of our reality</p><br>
<p>> even if they were, we would have no way to prove they arent inherent nature of our simulation</p><br>
<p>> we may have a divine layer in between us and our simulators, where a false god may lie</p><br>
<p>> if we cant be sure of our nature, any god could be real when faced with this dilemma, as nothing would have to be reasonable</p><br>
<p>> further down the chain of simulation, the idea of a potential true god becomes way too obscure and unbeknownst to us; if we were to simulate reality, we likely wouldnt feed them knowledge on all religions we know</p><br>
<p>> we could simulate pain and joy, nothing would have to be fair about our existence</p><br>
<p>> other strange experiences people report, deja vu, synchronicities, reality bending, may all just be errors in the code we live under</p><br><br>
<p>to say this is implausible would be to assume our "reality" is provable - it isnt. solipsism has been pondered on by the greatest minds and remains undefeated. not because its necessarily true, but because its untestable. nobody has ever proven conscience of another being, computed conscience would be just as plausible as the conscience of your best friend. with this, chained simulations, fractured conscience, and even false gods, is at worst, just as plausible as the reality the wider population accepts. at best, it may be even more plausible, as it directly addresses gaps in our knowledge rather than ignoring them entirely. we have no proof of base reality, no proof of other minds, no proof that the world remains when we close our eyes. we have logic, patterns, experiences and the likes to suggest there is something far deeper than we could ever know. maybe thats the point, not to find truth, but to seek it, not to break the simulation, just to understand it</p><br>
